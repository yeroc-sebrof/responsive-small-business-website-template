### Updates since fork

- Testing using Bootstrap version 4.5.3
- I've currently pulled away the PHP
  - I plan to make the includes be performed as a sed script. This will keep modularity while allowing the app to run in a CDN
  - I also need to make sure that nothing complains

------

**Live demo site:**  N/A (In process of moving away from PHP)
